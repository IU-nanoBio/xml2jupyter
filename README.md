# xml2jupyter
Using an XML configuration file, generate a graphical user interface (GUI) consisting of [Jupyter widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html). While this project is primarily targeting the [PhysiCell](http://physicell.mathcancer.org/) simulator and its configuration files, the software can be adapted for more general scenarios, especially if they involve XML configuration files.

The ```xml2jupyter.py``` Python script provides the core functionality for dynamically creating widgets from XML. The other Python scripts are static and provide a self-contained Jupyter GUI consisting of multiple tabs. Again, the overall GUI is written for the PhysiCell simulator - two tabs provide widgets for input parameters and two tabs allow visualization of data generated by PhysiCell.

## Installation
This project requires a Python distribution with modules not found in the standard
library. In particular, it needs matplotlib (and all its dependencies), scipy.io, and Jupyter (notebooks). You have at least a couple of different options:

1) Perhaps the easiest way to get all of this is to download and install the Anaconda Python 3.x distribution:
https://www.anaconda.com/download/
however, that distribution (which includes a LOT of additional modules), is ~500-600MB.

2) If you want to downlod a much smaller bundle, but in multiple steps, you could try to:
- download the Miniconda Python 3.x installer (preferably 64-bit):  (~30 MB)
https://conda.io/miniconda.html

then install the additional, required modules:
```
conda install matplotlib
conda install scipy
conda install jupyter
```

## Usage

Copy your .xml file to ```test.xml```, e.g.,
```
$ cp config_samples/config_biorobots.xml test.xml
```

After you have the desired Python modules:

- Copy your project's configuration file (.xml) to this directory, calling it "myconfig.xml"
- Copy your project's executable to this directory, e.g., ```heterogeneity```, in the example below.
- Generate the Python module of widgets for your user params (a "tab" in the Notebook GUI). From a Terminal/Command Prompt window, run:

```python gen_user_tab.py myconfig.xml```

Then run the notebook:

```jupyter notebook PhysiCell.ipynb```


When the notebook starts in your browser, in the "Cell" menu, click "Run All".

Make changes to the configuration parameters via the Jupyter notebook GUI, press the 'Write' button, then run your simulation from a shell window, e.g.:

```
heterogeneity myconfig.xml
```
If you don't have your current working directory in your PATH, you will need to be more explicit, e.g.:
```
./heterogeneity myconfig.xml     # on Unix
.\heterogeneity myconfig.xml     # on Windows
```
